##🚀 Project Launch | PredictX Bikes – Used Bike Price Prediction Web App 🏍️💰##

I’m excited to share my latest end-to-end Machine Learning project — PredictX Bikes, an AI-powered web application that predicts used bike resale prices using real-world data.

🔍 What this project does:
PredictX Bikes helps sellers, buyers, and dealers estimate a fair market price for second-hand bikes, reducing guesswork and negotiation friction.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
• Python & Machine Learning
• Flask (Backend)
• HTML, CSS (Frontend)
• Pickle (.pkl) ML model
• Render (Cloud Deployment)
• GitHub (Version Control)

📊 Key Features:
✅ ML-based price prediction
✅ Clean Flask web interface
✅ Real-world dataset
✅ Deployed & live on Render
✅ End-to-end project (EDA → Model → Deployment)

🎯 Use Cases:
• Used bike sellers & buyers
• Dealership pricing support
• Online resale platforms
• Insurance & asset valuation

🔮 Future Scope:
• Location-based pricing
• Real-time market data integration
• Model retraining with feedback
• Mobile app & API support
